# GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA)

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic search method that has been used in Artificial Intelligence. Genetic Algorithm usually used to identify the optimize solutions of search problem. 

## PURPOSE

This purpose of this programming assignment is to analyze and design Genetic Algorithm program in order to finds the minimum value of the heuristic function. 

## HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
